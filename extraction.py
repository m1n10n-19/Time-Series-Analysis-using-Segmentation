'''
Extract primitives from the file 'sampled_wave_data_1.csv' in an unsupervised manner. 
how to proceed? first let us try fixed lenth primjitives 
- segmentation at different lengths 
- then look at differences between y coordinates(slopes) 
- will be categorized as the same primitive if signs match and zeros match
- count distinct number of primitives
- figure out how to represent the curver using these primitives
- compactness will be the best compressed representation
- in addition to the primitiive slopes
